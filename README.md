Create your document site with only **ONE** command.

## Life gets easier

To create your document site, just:

```sh
npm install document -g
cd /path/to/your/repo
document
```

Oh YEAH! That's it! We made it!

## Feature

- Could not be easier ! Just ONE command!
- Build with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), yeah !
- Support CommonJS [package/1.0](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0) spec.
- Designed to minimize arguments and configurations as much as possible.
- Support documents of multiple languages.
- Supports [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).
- Support subdirectories.
- Lovely and SEO friendly URLs.
- Application cache so that to afford heavy traffic.
- Custom themes and dev guide with `grunt-init` task. (what's comming...) 
- `document` middleware for [express.js](http://expressjs.com). (what's comming...)


## Usage

Visit [the document site](http://kael.me/document) for details.

### Specify the `doc` Directory

By default, if your repo is based on commonjs, `document` will use the [`directories.doc`](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0#Package_Directory_Layout) field of the package.json as the document root.

If there's no package.json or no `directories.doc` field, `document` will use `'doc'` folder by default.

But you can specify it by using `--doc` argument, for example:

```sh
document --doc /somewhere/else
```

### Basic Informations

It's best to use `document` command at the root of your repo, in order to read the package.json.

`document` will try to read the 'config.json' file inside the `doc` folder, which has higher priority upon 'package.json'.

## Why a node.js version of daux.io?

The first time I met daux.io: Wow.

Setting up nginx conf and tring to install daux.io under a sub path: Oh no!

Spelunking into the source code: \_(:3」∠)\_

That's it.


## Credits

`document@0.x.x` uses the theme of [daux.io](daux.io), thanks a million.
